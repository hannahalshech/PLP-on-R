Does your language include multiple types of loops (while, do/while, for, foreach)? If so, what
are they and how do they differ from each other?
**The types of loops that can be executed in R are for, while, and foreach. The main difference between a for and while loop is that the
number of loops  necessary is known before running with a for loop, and typically isn't when using a while loop. The foreach loop is more
in-order than a for loop, and a bit more structured. In R, you must download a package in order to utilize foreach loops, which is shown
at the top of the R file.**
2. What is the syntax for declaring a function in your language?
**In R, this is an example of the syntax for declaring a function:
myfunction <- function(variable){
        content
        }
You can name your function whatever you want, and pass in whatever variables necessary.**
4. Are there any rules about where the function has to be placed in your code file so that it can
run?
**No, there are no rules about where the function has to be placed, because in R, you highlight the text and click the 'Run' button in order
to run a specific function or other piece of code. It doesn't all get run at the same time unless you would like it to be.**
4. Does your language support recursive functions?
**Yes, R supports recursive functions, and you can find an example of one in the R file attached.**
6. Can functions in your language accept multiple parameters? Can they be of different data
types?
**Yes, functions in R can accept multiple parameters. They can be of different data types, depending on what is being done to them in the function,
but in most cases it is acceptable and will run.**
6. Can functions in your language return multiple values at the same time? How is that
implemented? If not, are there ways around that problem? What are they?
**In R, you cannot return multiple values at the same time. The only workaround is utilizing a list or similar data type.**
7. Is your language pass-by reference or value? Check your code against outside sources in case
there is anything tricky going on (like in Perl).
**R is pass-by-value. An example of this and how it runs can be seen in the attached code.**
8. Are there any other aspects of functions in your language that aren't specifically asked about
here, but that are important to know in order to write one? What are they?
**I found functions in R to be quite easy to use and navigate, and if you run into issues, there are many reliable sources of information to be found on 
the Internet, including free eBooks.**
